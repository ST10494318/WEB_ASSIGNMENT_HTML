PART 2 IMPLMMENTED STYLING

CSS Styling Implementation

1. Desktop Styling
1.1 External Stylesheet

Created an external CSS file style.css and linked it to all HTML files.

Used consistent class and ID naming.

1.2 Base Style

Defined default styles for font-family, font-size, color scheme, and margins/padding.

Used a CSS reset  margin: 0; padding: 0; box-sizing: border-box;  to ensure consistent styling across browsers.

1.3 Typography Styles

Applied font-family, font-size, line-height, and letter-spacing for readability.

Used typography scales to maintain consistent text hierarchy.

1.4 Layout Structure

Implemented CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout structure.

Applied CSS properties like display: flex, justify-content, align-items, and grid-template-areas.

1.5 Visual Styles

Used properties such as color, background-color, border, and box-shadow for styling.

Added interactive pseudo-classes like :hover, :focus, and :active.

2. Responsive Design
2.1 Breakpoints

Defined breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile using media queries.

Multi-column layout for desktop, switching to single-column on smaller screens.

2.2 Relative Units

Used em and rem for font sizes and spacing.

Used % for widths and heights to make elements flexible.

2.3 Responsive Images

Implemented srcset and sizes attributes for adaptive image loading.

Used picture lement for optimized images across devices.

2.4 Testing

Used browser dev tools to test on multiple screen sizes.

Included screenshots of desktop, tablet, and mobile versions (see below).

Iterated on design to improve user experience.

3. Additional Best Practices

Prioritised Content: Kept content as the main focus.

Kept It Simple: Avoided unnecessary complexity.
